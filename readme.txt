== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q: How do I use the plugin?

A: Visit the "dashboard" section from within /wp-admin/ and seek out the dashboard widget that lists your pages. (see screenshot)

Q: I've looked everywhere on the dashboard, there is no widget for pages.

A: Check the "screen options" dropdown, located in the upper right area of the dashboard. Make sure the the dashboard widget is not disabled (no checkbox next to the widget). If its active and you still cannot see the widget you theme or another plugin is blocking dashboard widgets.

Q: Where is the options panel?

A: There is no options panel.

== Screenshots ==

1. Sample of the "dashboard" page within wp-admin where the widget is active and moved to the top left of the dashboard. (note you can click and drag the widgets around from the title of each widget)
